Package 147

Snell Roundhand is a script typeface designed by Matthew Carter. With
the exception of the lower case x and z, the lower case characters have
a stroke leading out of the right hand side that overlaps the beginning
of the next character. This overlap compensates for slight differences
in positioning, particularly in digital letter forms, that may occur
from point size and resolution variations. In addition, an optional
lead-in stroke character has been provided for those who like the rare
special effect of such a character. It can be found on the backslash key
of the keyboard, and may, if desired, be used to create the lead-in
stroke for a lower case character at the beginning of an all lower-case
word.

The typefaces in this package are display typefaces designed to be used
at sizes of 18 points and greater. Screen resolution is poor at smaller
sizes due to the resolution limitations of screen devices. These
limitations do not affect printed output, but these fonts may still be
hard to read at small sizes.

Many PC applications have separate menus for selecting typeface families and
typeface styles. Most applications let you choose among regular, bold, and
italic styles in the Style menu. However, some Adobe Type Library packages
include font software with additional style variations and stroke weight
variations. To select these variations, you need to know how the bold and
italic styles are linked to the base typeface. For example, the New Caledonia
typeface includes semi-bold, bold, and black. To use New Caledonia Black, you
need to choose New Caledonia SemiBold from the application's Font menu (or
equivalent), and then choose Bold from the Style menu (or equivalent).

If you are using a Microsoft Windows application, Ventura Publisher or
Microsoft Word, follow the guide to typeface style selection below. (The
Microsoft Word menu name will be as listed below but with any spaces in it
removed.) If you are using an application other than these, refer to the
application's documentation.

If you are reading this document using Windows Notepad, please make sure to
set your left and right margins to zero before printing.
